            The Tonight Show is the longest-running television show in history, airing on NBC. NBC is owned by Comcast, with over 136K employees.

          <h2>NBCUniversal is HUGE</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>David, what do you think of when you hear the words "Enterprise software"? (large, complicated, slow, 18 months to launch).</p>

            <p>But, think about just the basics that need to happen for a new or re-launched talk show.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing the host (they will lead the creative direction)</li>
              <li>Building the staff to support the show</li>
              <li>Defining the creative direction and content of the show.</li>
              <li>This has to happen <strong>before</strong> technical work can start.</li>
            </ul>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>We can't build a (useful) website until</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A host is chosen</li>
            <li>The creative direction is defined</li>
            <li>This has to happen <strong>before</strong> technical work can start.</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Even then, this just gets us to a website that could mirror the show.</p>
            <p>We need to treat the web as something that isn't just bolted-on to a show. It needs to be a first-class component of the show experience.</p>
            <p>A successful show site isn't just a list of episodes; it's got to be a channel for both repeat and unique content.</p>
            <p>In the case of The Tonight Show, by the middle of December 2013 most of this work was complete enough to begin work on the site and apps.</p>
            <p>Hard show launch date of February 17th, 2014, with a pre-show site needing to be launched a few weeks before.</p>

          AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! (need graphic)
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Before we get into how we approached this from the tech, let's talk about who was involved.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>The Guests</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>NBC Digital; they're responsible for anything and everything digital for the NBC television brand. It's their job to build and maintain whatever online tools shows need to be effective, competitive, and engaging.</p>
            <p>CP+B (TODO: Full name?); the primary contractor for TSJF, they were responsible for designing and building both the web app and the mobile apps.</p>

            <p>Four Kitchens and Lullabot composed the "Drupal crack team"; both companies provided consultants, Drupal expertise, and developer resources.</p>

            <p>NBC Operations and Tools Support; They're the team behind the Publisher 7 Drupal distribution used internally at NBC Digital.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>TODO: Replace with venn diagram of teams and primary expertise.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>CP+B: Front end, apps</li>
            <li>NBC: Show expertise, infrastruction, production systems.</li>
            <li>"Drupal crack team": 4K, Lullabot, +1 CP+B, occasional NBC (though worked on nbc.com)</li>
            <li>Video integration expert: Lullabot (Matt K)</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Not only did we have a complex site to build, with a tight timeline, we had to with with a distributed team in both place and time.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          TODO: Insert map of where everyone was. Talk about the TZ range (remember QA).

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We have all of these team members, with such variance between them. I remember thinking "if this project is going to launch with anywhere near what they want, we'll really need to structure the architecture itself to be non-blocking."</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <blockquote>To succeed, we need a non-blocking technical architecture.</blockquote>

        <section>
          <p>In a way, it's like winning at "Lip Synch Battle"</p>
          TODO: Need images from lip synch battle bit.

          <ul>
            <li>Be flexible</li>
            <li>Have some bits prepared</li>
            <li>You won't know what is coming, but you can practice how you will react</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
               <li>allow independent itteration on all layers of the site</li>
               <li>Play to our strengths - reduce and simplify developer dependencies</li>
               <li>Foster a mindset and a language not a prescription</li>
             </ul>
         </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The two biggest components of this approach are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <abbr>COPE</abbr> Decoupled technology stack</li>
            <li>Semantic content model</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
             <p>A decoupled app &amp; web front end with a services based Drupal API layer.</p>
             <p>And an abstracted semantic content model that supported great itteration.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What was that now? Semantic whatsit?</h2>
          <p>We started with the API thinking that providing outs would unblock the app and front end teams</p>
          <p>However that led to a lot of 1-1 endpoints - a non-agnostic API approach</p>
          <aside class="notes">
             <p>I'll explain in a moment but let's start with how we got there.</p>
             <p>We started working on the API first but we quickly observed we were headed down a prescriptive and unsustainable path. Endpoints tended to be requests for very specific resources and the front end was dictating the content model.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>FAIL BOAT</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This was pretty clearly not going to help us suceed.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Front end and back ends are very coupled.</li>
              <li>Content model does not have the flexibility show producers need</li>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>So... what is Semantic Content modeling?</h2>
          <p>Content structures that resemble real-life elements of your business</p>
          <p>For the Tonight Show that meant putting the content resources together like the show.</p>
          <ul>
             <li>Segments</li>
             <li>Bits</li>
             <li>Jokes</li>
             <li>Guests<li>
             <li>Challenges</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Benefits of Semantic Content Modeling: A Shared Meaningful Language</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>Gave all teams - developers, q/a, editorial a shared meaningful language that was native both to the show and the web stack.</p>
            <p>Make sense editorially for the long term</p>
            <p>Provided a clearer editorial workflow</p>
