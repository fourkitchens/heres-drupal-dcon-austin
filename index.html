            <p>The Tonight Show is the longest-running television show in history, airing on NBC. It's got a long, storied history, with over 11,000 episodes since 1954.</p>

            <p>This is The Tonight Show on NBC.com. The site is responsive, touch friendly, and heavily focused on image and video content. Here's Drupal!</p>
            <p>But not really. Drupal's just one component of several different systems, each built and tuned to support a specific set of functionality.</p>
            <p>Today, David and I are going to talk about how we went from a Drupal installation screen, all the way to what you see today.</p>
            <p>NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast, with over 136K employees.</p>

            <p>What do you think of when you hear the words "Enterprise software"?</p>
            <ul>

              <li>Complicated</li>
              <li>Slow</li>
              <li>18 months</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But, think about just the basics that need to happen for a new or re-launched talk show.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing the host (they will lead the creative direction)</li>
              <li>Building the staff to support the show</li>
              <li>Defining the creative direction and content of the show.</li>
              <li>This has to happen <strong>before</strong> technical work can start.</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Even then, this just gets us to a website that could mirror the show.</p>
            <p>We need to treat the web as something that isn't just bolted-on to a show. It needs to be a first-class component of the show experience.</p>
            <p>A successful show site isn't just a list of episodes; it's got to be a channel for both repeat and unique content.</p>
            <p>In the case of The Tonight Show, by the middle of December 2013 most of this work was complete enough to begin work on the site and apps.</p>
            <p>Hard show launch date of February 17th, 2014, with a pre-show site needing to be launched a few weeks before.</p>

        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Our first task was to define the systems that needed to be built, and who owned what.</p>
            <p>Then, we could map each system to each team's primary expertise and give them ownership over the product.</p>
            <p>We started from the source of content (to us) and moved through each system all the way to the end user.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All non-video content from the show's producers into Publisher 7.</li>
              <li>Video content from MPX, curated by producers in P7.</li>
              <li>P7 would be owned by the "Drupal crack team"; 4K, Lullabot</li>
              <li>The API design was handled by the two Drupal architects and the lead CP+B architect.</li>
              <li>Front end and apps handled by CP+B.</li>

            <aside class="notes">
               <p>I'll explain our Semantic content model in a moment but let's start with how we got there.</p>
               <p>We started working on the API first we all throught we could unblock all teams for asynchronous work</p>
               <p>BUT we quickly observed we were headed down a prescriptive and unsustainable path.</p>
               <p>Andrew, what were some of the problems we saw rear their head at that point?</p>
               <p>Endpoints tended to be requests for very specific resources and the front end was dictating the content model.</p>
               <p>The initial design was display centric with some concessions for REST</p>

          <section>
            <h2 class="static-title">So...Semantic what now?</h2>
            <p>We started designing the API thinking that setting outputs would unblock the app and front end teams</p>
            <p>However that led to a lot of 1-1 endpoints - a non-agnostic API approach</p>
            <p>The initial design was display centric with some concessions for REST</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This was pretty close to a blocking workflow and clearly not going to help us suceed.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Front end and back ends are very coupled - reduces reusability.</li>
              <li>Content model did not have the flexibility production staff need longterm</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on this approach we realized that the biggest unblocker would be a quality content model</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>It can be easy in Drupal to have a page centric content model, you start your model from the pages or sections you want available and that then drives the fields, content and their relations</p>
              <p>But who does that put in the driver's seat?</p>

              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Your site is driving your content in this page centric model, wouldn't you prefer that your content drive the site? It's a more sustainable and more meaningful model.</p>
                <p>Semantic Content Modeling would have you create structures that resemble the real-life elements of your business</p>
                <p>Since Drupal wasn't responsible for pages at all but content we had some very clear freedom from that pattern, which, was helpful in creating agnostic and dependency free endpoints.</p>

              <p>Eddie Lee from NBC Digital had this great insight to really push for the idea that the smallest meaningful component of the late show, is the joke, and that we could build from there.</p>
              <p>It coincided perfectly with the mission of the site, the apps, and the property, to provide shareable moments that viewers, fans and their networks can experience the best moments time and again.</p>

              <p>This allowed our System to be the architect, Decoupled development needs a connecting tissue - that could be a person, a spec, or a system - since we couldn't be available all the time our design manifested in the API could and was.</p>

              <p>EXAMPLES: - A brand new resource needs to be created we have that stubbed. We even went so far as to detail how inner endpoint resources would look - so teams could build their features ahead of actual drupal implementation.</p>

            <p>Provided a highly customizable way to select indvidual and groups of semantic and display-centric content for endpoints</p>
            <p>Content caching and permissions, and responsive ready inner resource patterns in a familiar way to the enterprise (in use on one other property)</p>

          <p>Let us utilize strong PHP OOP resources</p>
          <p>OOP inheritence let us shift Drupalisms lower down and simplify implementing classes</p>
          <p>Simpler implementations allowed quicker and cleaner review of asynchronous work.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Even within a services based API solution - there are options - why not site build for speed? - It may be fast to get out there but it is not fast to itterate on asynchronously.</p>
            <p>OOP code was more sensible than features or views code - easy to see what had been changed while teams worked around the clock and easy to extend cleanly and consistently</p>
            <p>Using a heavliy PHP OOP solution let us leverage the available expertise and resources in a sustainable way - still deliver a familiar editorial and backend solution.</p>
            <p>Solve for the obtuse in one place - keep drupalisms low to the ground </p>
